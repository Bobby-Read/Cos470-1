# COS 470 - Tuesday 2019-09-05
## Objectives
* Get students ready for assignment1

## Notes
* Consider subscribing to my repo
* Invitation to join open source project
* bring a water bottle
* Office hours
* Specified late work policy. @me for late work
* thanks for surveys

## Class
* Topics
  * Debugging
  * File IO
  * Generics
  * Data Structures
  * Linq
* Handling Null
  * nullable primitives like int?
  * ternary ? : ;
  * null coalescence ??
  * null conditional ?.
* Debugging
  * Breakpoints
  * Step through code with: in, out, over
  * explore objects by hovering, pin these values values
  * callstack window
  * immediate window
  * c# interactive window
  * Questions?
* File OI
  * to read file as a string
	* var text = File.ReadAllText("Path")
	* text.split("delimiter")
  * to read file as a stream (probably better for large files)
    * var stream = File.OpenRead("path")
	* var reader = new StreamReader(stream)
	* both of those are IDisposable! Use a using()
	* var word = reader.Read();
  * Writing a file will look similar to reading, but the opposite.
  * Questions?
* Data structures
  * arrays
    * initializers
	* indexing
	* multi-dimensional
  * Generics or "parametric types"
    * classes
	* functions
	* generic constraints
  * IEnumerable<T>
    * Parametric Typing, (with primitives!)
    * can't change a collection while enumerating it
    * yield return, yield break
	* linq work off this!
  * List<T>
  * dictionary<K,V>
    * hashing (hashing strings, careful)
  * hashset<T>
  * Queue<T>
* Delegates (introduced, more next class)
  * Anonymous functions
    * Func<,>
  * Lambda expressions: a => a % 2 == 0
* System.Linq (touched on this)
