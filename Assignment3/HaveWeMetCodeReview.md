# Have we met? (part 2)
Assigned: 2019/10/03
Due: 2019/10/08

### Context
* Your coworker just wrote some code. You understand the basics of what they are trying to accomplish but not how they decided to implement their solution. It's "done" and now they need someone to check their work.

### First: Read
* [code review stuff](https://github.com/features/code-review/)
* [more code review stuff](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)

### Second: Review
* Find the Email from Alex pairing you with someone else.
  * Didn't get an email or you their project isn't done... I don't know, email Alex about it.
* Add the other person's github account as a contributor on your repo.
  * account is found in their github url.
  * go to settings, collaborators to add them.
* Accept the "invitation" to be a contributor on their repo. (you'll get this by email)
* Find their Assignment 3 pull request. Find `Files Changed`
* Comment on their pull request:
  * Things they did well
  * Things which might produce undesirable functionality
    * Corner cases, inefficiencies, bugs, something that could be tested but isn't
  * Things which make the code difficult to maintain
    * poorly organized, unnecessarily complex...
  * Constructive criticism identifies a problem AND suggests how to improve it.
  * Maybe it really is perfect and there is nothing that can be improved. Fine.
* Wait for them to comment on your Pull request and respond:
  * "Thanks, I'll keep that in mind for next time"
  * "Good catch, I've fixed it. (See my most recent changes)"
  * You don't need to fix the small stuff, but it would be good practice!
* Do not merge the pull request (yours or theirs)

### Third: Profit
